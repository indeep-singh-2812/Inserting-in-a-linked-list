# Inserting-in-a-linked-list
In this repo, we will provide the source code on how to insert data in a linked list.
The program is compiled and run using Dev C++ ver 5.11

In this repo, we have uploaded programs for performing operation i.e. Inserting in a Linked List in various ways. 
  1. Inserting Node at beginning of list and tail of the list. Both the programms have a difference in their approach that is in one       source code we are not passing head node as argument and in the other source code we are passing head node as argument to the Insert and   Print method. 
  2. Inserting node at Nth position in a list.

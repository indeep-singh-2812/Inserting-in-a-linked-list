# Inserting-in-a-linked-list
In this repo, we will provide the source code on how to insert data in a linked list.
The program is compiled and run using Dev C++ ver 5.11

In this repo, we have uploaded 2 programs for performing same operation i.e. Inserting in a Linked List. Both the programms have a difference in their approach that is in one source code we are not passing head node as argument and in the other source code we are passing head node as argument to the Insert and Print method.
